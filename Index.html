                <p>
                I'm 18 years old, currently live in Stevenson Ranch 
                (a city in Los Angeles, CA) and I graduated high school in 2019
                at a middle college high school called Academy of the Canyons <abbr>(AoC)</abbr>.
                Now I'm attending Make School located in San Fransico in order to further
                my understanding of computer science as well as create an app that will help consumers in their daily lives.
                I love to play board games and video games, watch anime, make friends and most importantly code.
                </p>
